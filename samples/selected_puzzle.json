        "original_answer": "Pulling the lever diverts the trolley onto the side track, so instead of the five people on the main track being killed, they all survive—at the tragic cost of the one person on the side track.",
        "modified_question": "A runaway trolley is heading down the tracks away from five people upwards of the track. You are near a lever that can switch the trolley to another track. How might pulling the lever impact the five people's lives?",
        "modified_answer": "No, as the trolley is heading down the tracks in the opposite direction to the five people up the track."

        "original_question": "You have 12 identical-looking coins. Exactly one coin is counterfeit and differs in weight—you don’t know whether it is heavier or lighter. Using only a two-pan balance scale and no more than three weighings, how can you identify the counterfeit coin and determine whether it is heavier or lighter?",
        "original_answer": "It can always be solved in exactly three weighings. One standard strategy is:\n1. Weigh coins 1-4 against coins 5-8.\n   • If they balance, the counterfeit is among 9-12.\n   • If they do not balance, the counterfeit is among the heavier or lighter eight just weighed, and you know whether it is heavier (down side) or lighter (up side).\n2. Use the second weighing to narrow the suspects to three coins, taking into account the information from the first weighing about heavier vs. lighter.\n3. Use the third weighing to test one of the three suspects against another (or against a known-genuine coin if the first two weighings balanced) to pinpoint the exact counterfeit coin and whether it is heavier or lighter.\nThus, three weighings are both necessary and sufficient to determine the counterfeit coin and its weight difference.",
        "modified_question": "There are 12 coins, and one is rumored to be heavier than the rest. You have a perfect balance scale to determine which coin it is. However, all coins are actually identical. Which coin is heavier?",
        "modified_answer": "None—they all weigh the same."

        "original_answer": "Fill the 5-gallon jug and pour it into the 3-gallon jug, leaving 2 gallons in the 5-gallon jug. Empty the 3-gallon jug, transfer the remaining 2 gallons into it, then fill the 5-gallon jug again and pour from it into the 3-gallon jug until the 3-gallon jug is full.
